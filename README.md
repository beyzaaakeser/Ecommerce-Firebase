<h1>My Ecommerce Firebase Project</h1>

This e-commerce project was developed with React (Vite) to provide a high-performance frontend. Firebase's real-time database and authentication features allowed users to securely create accounts, log in, and make payments. A user-friendly page routing structure was created with React-Router-Dom, allowing seamless transitions to product catalogs, carts, and payment pages.

The user can add products to the cart, update product quantities, and see total prices dynamically. These features were supported with warning and information messages with React-Toastify to increase user experience. React-Icons and Bootstrap provided a visually modern and user-friendly interface to the project. In addition, a project ready for production was achieved with fast development experience and optimized configurations using Vite.
